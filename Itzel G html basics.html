        <h1> Itzel's Favorite Hobby </h1>
            <p> My favorite hobby is collecting stickers. </p>

            <h2> Collecting Stickers </h2>

            <p> I like to collect stickers of any kind because: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> It's like collecting memories</li>
                <li> I get to reminisce about the places that I've been to </li>
                <li> I can keep track of things I used to be interested in</li>
                <li> When I collect enough stickers, I can make a collage of everything I have collected </li>
            </ul>

            <p> I get my stickers from:</p>
            <ol>
                <li> My older sister gifts me stickers that she thinks I would like </li>
                <li> Sticker books that I have bought throughout the years </li>
                <li> Gift shops at museums or famous places </li>
            </ol>

            <h2> What It Means To Me </h2>

            <p><em> Reminiscing </em> about the times I spent with friends and family on adventures brings me great happiness. </p>
            <p> Keeping track of those times makes me think about the <strong> growth and change </strong> we all have as people. </p>
            <p> <em> <strong> Reflecting on myself and others can bring a positive change </strong></em></p>

            <h2> Thanks! </h2>
            <p> Thank you for reading! I hope you got to know me better. </p>
            <p> Sincerely, <br/>
                Itzel Gomez </p>
